    As a graduate technologist in the firm I have worked in two teams:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Credit technology: where I worked on the intraday risk systems and infrastructure.
    \item Athena Strategies: where I currently develop the web application infrastructure to enable
    business teams to develop web applications using the latest tools. 
    \end{itemize}
